# CenSys Gate Remote for Home Assistant

Control and monitor your Centurion **SMART Wi-Fi gate operator** (e.g. **D5 Evo SMART**) directly from Home Assistant — open and close the gate, see live open/closed status, and track battery, mains power, safety beams and more.

> **Status: beta.** This is an unofficial, community-built integration and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Centurion Systems. It talks to the same cloud service the official CenSys app uses. Use at your own risk; feedback is very welcome (see [Giving feedback](#giving-feedback)).

---

## Features

- **Gate cover** — open / close from the dashboard, automations, voice assistants, etc.
- **Live status** — the gate animates `opening → open → closing → closed` in real time while it moves, then settles to the steady status.
- **Rich diagnostics** — battery voltage, mains/power supply status, safety-beam states, online/offline, fault and warranty flags, last-seen time, and Wi-Fi signal.
- **Simple onboarding** — sign in with your phone number and a one-time SMS code, exactly like the app.

---

## Requirements

- **Home Assistant 2024.1 or newer.**
- A **Centurion SMART Wi-Fi operator** that is already set up and working in the official **CenSys / MyCentsys Remote** app.
- The **phone number** registered to that operator in the app (you'll receive an SMS code during setup).
- Home Assistant must have **outbound internet access** (the integration talks to Centurion's cloud).

There are no extra Python packages to install by hand — Home Assistant installs everything the integration needs automatically on first start.

---

## Installation

This repository **is** the integration, so its files go straight into a `centsys_remote` folder under your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.

1. In your Home Assistant configuration directory, create the folder `custom_components/centsys_remote/` (create `custom_components` first if it doesn't exist).
2. Download this repository — the green **Code → Download ZIP** button, or `git clone` — and copy **all of its files** into that folder, so you end up with:

   ```
   <config>/custom_components/centsys_remote/__init__.py
   <config>/custom_components/centsys_remote/manifest.json
   ... (and the rest of the files)
   ```

   - **HAOS / Supervised:** use the *Samba share* or *Studio Code Server* add-on to copy the files into `config/custom_components/centsys_remote/`.
   - **Container / Core:** copy them into your mapped config directory, e.g. `scp -r centsys_remote/* user@homeassistant:/config/custom_components/centsys_remote/`.

3. **Restart Home Assistant** (a full restart, not just "Quick reload"). On first boot it will install the integration's dependencies — give it a minute.

> **HACS:** support is planned for a later release. For now, please use the manual method above.

---

## Setup

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Search for **CenSys Gate Remote**.
3. Enter the **phone number** registered to your gate (optionally a name/email). An **SMS code** is sent to that number.
4. Enter the **code** to finish. Your gate(s) appear as a device with all the entities below.

If you have more than one operator on your account, all of them are added.

---

## Entities

Each gate operator becomes one device. The main control is the **cover**; everything else is read-only.

### Controls

| Entity | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Gate** (cover) | Open / close the gate. Centurion operators are single-button triggers, so both buttons pulse the gate and it decides direction from its current position — just like the physical remote. The control greys out to reflect the current state (open disabled when already open, etc.). |

### Sensors

| Entity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Operator status** | `open`, `closed`, `opening`, `closing`, `partly open`, `partly closed`. |
| **Battery voltage** | Operator battery voltage (V). Refreshed on a slower cycle — see [About the battery & live telemetry](#about-the-battery--live-telemetry). |
| **Power supply** | Mains/power supply condition: `normal`, `low`, `off`, `unknown`. |
| **Closing safety beam** / **Opening safety beam** | Beam condition: `clear`, `obstructed`, `disabled`, etc. |
| **Theft alarm state** | `activated`, `cleared`, `disabled`. |
| **Last seen** | When the operator last reported to the cloud. |
| **Wi-Fi signal** | Operator Wi-Fi RSSI (disabled by default — enable it in the entity settings if you want it). |
| **Operator temperature** | Reported board temperature (disabled by default; not populated on all models). |

### Binary sensors

| Entity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Online** | Whether the operator is currently reachable. |
| **Fault** | Operator-reported fault/health problem. |
| **Warranty void** | Warranty flag (disabled by default). |

> Sensors marked *disabled by default* won't appear until you enable them: open the device, click the entity, then the cog → **Enable**.

## Using it

Once set up, the gate behaves like any other cover in Home Assistant:

- **Dashboard:** add the gate as a tile or cover card. The tile card gives a compact open/close control.
- **Automations & scripts:** use the standard `cover.open_cover`, `cover.close_cover` services, or the cover state in conditions/triggers.
- **Voice / mobile:** works with anything that understands HA covers.

Example automation — notify if the gate is left open for more than 5 minutes:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Gate left open
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: cover.d5_evo_smart   # use your gate's entity id
        to: "open"
        for: "00:05:00"
    actions:
      - action: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          message: "The gate has been open for 5 minutes."
```

## About the battery & live telemetry

- **Live open/close status** is real time: when you press open/close, the integration follows the gate's live updates for the duration of the cycle, so the cover animates accurately.
- **Battery voltage and similar deep diagnostics** come from a heavier check that briefly wakes the operator, so they refresh on a **slower schedule (about every 15 minutes)**, not every few seconds. After first setup the **battery voltage may show *unknown* until the first telemetry cycle completes** — this is normal. It will populate shortly.
- Battery is reported as **voltage** (e.g. `13.4 V`) rather than a percentage, because that's the trustworthy value the operator provides. A reading around 13–14 V typically means the operator is on mains with a healthy battery.

## Enabling debug logging

If something isn't working, debug logs make it much easier to help. Add this to your `configuration.yaml`, then restart Home Assistant:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.centsys_remote: debug
```

You can then watch the logs live under **Settings → System → Logs** (use **Load full logs**), or download them to attach to a bug report.

To turn debug logging back off, remove those lines and restart, or run the **Logger: Set level** action with level `info`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **"CenSys Gate Remote" doesn't appear in Add Integration.** Make sure the files are at `config/custom_components/centsys_remote/` (with `manifest.json` directly inside) and that you did a **full restart**. Clear your browser cache if needed.
- **No SMS code arrives.** Confirm the number is exactly the one registered in the CenSys app (including country code) and that it can receive SMS. You can retry the setup flow.
- **Gate won't open from HA but works in the app.** Check the operator is **Online** in HA, and that your account still has permission in the app. Enable debug logging and capture what happens when you press open.
- **Battery voltage stays *unknown*.** Wait for a telemetry cycle (up to ~15 minutes), or restart HA. If it never populates, the operator may have been asleep/offline at each attempt — grab debug logs.
- **State seems to lag.** Steady-state status refreshes about once a minute; live motion is tracked in real time during an open/close. Brief states between polls are expected to be smoothed by the live follow.

---

## Removing the integration

1. **Settings → Devices & Services → CenSys Gate Remote → ⋮ → Delete.** This removes the device, all entities, and your stored login.
2. (Optional) Delete the `custom_components/centsys_remote` folder.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

Always delete via the UI **before** removing the folder, so Home Assistant can clean up properly.

---

## Privacy & security

- Your login is stored only inside Home Assistant's config entry for this integration; removing the integration deletes it.
- The integration communicates with Centurion's cloud service over encrypted connections.
- No data is sent anywhere other than Centurion's service.

## Giving feedback

This is a beta — please report anything odd! When opening an issue, it helps to include:

- Your Home Assistant version and how you run it (HAOS, Container, etc.).
- Your operator model (e.g. D5 Evo SMART).
- What you expected vs. what happened.
- Relevant **debug logs** (see [Enabling debug logging](#enabling-debug-logging)).

Thanks for testing!
